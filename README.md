Today's the Day in History


Introduction
------------

Today was written and maintained by James Miskin between 1991 and 2006. In around 2006, it was updated for 32-bit use by Steve Fryatt.


Building
--------

Today needs to be built using the [Desktop Development Environment](https://www.riscosopen.org/content/sales/dde) from RISC OS Open.

It can be checked out from the GitHub repository using the Git client from RISC OS Open.

You will need to have two utilities - BuildInfo and XMLMan - installed on your Run Path for the build to work. These can be obtained from <https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/programming-tools>, and the easiest way to ensure that they are found is to install them into Boot:Library.

With this setup complete and the DDE having been seen, running the Mk TaskObey file in the project folder should build the documentation and !RunImage file within the !Today application.
